**Join a Bank Board**

To really learn about banking, I invite you to consider becoming a director of a community bank.  The banks we help start focus in large part on the types of businesses represented by directors on the board.  This allows us to integrate their knowledge and experience with the needs of the bank.

**Types of business people who serve on bank boards of community banks we help start.**

We have helped start 31 banks with about 400 directors and about 1,000 advisory board members.  What are their backgrounds?  They are all successful business leaders with huge networks of friends and associates.  All are required to be approved by bank regulators and submit to an FBI check.

As an example, on two of our banks in progress, we have 4 investment advisors/brokers/counselors/bankers, people that understand investments.  They have managed hundreds of millions of dollars in assets.  They have license series 7, 3, 63, 9 and 10\.  One was a Trustee of a Disney Trust Foundation.

In addition, our bank boards and advisory bank boards include a General who was U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff, a former Arizona Governor,  3 former State Legislators, a former Counsel in Washington to Senator John McCain, former 

Deputy Chief of Staff and Senior Advisor to two Arizona Governors, a former Senior Advisor to the Mayor of Phoenix, a former Special Agent investigating organized crime and public corruption for 4 Attorneys General, and three anti-terrorist experts.

We have even had a former Arizona attorney general on a bank board, and a former Phoenix police chief on an advisory board.  The list goes on!  In addition, numerous of our directors have published books and own patents.

You would be keeping pretty good company.  And, so would they if you come on board.
